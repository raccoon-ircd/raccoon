Scope of this document
======================

This document describes the commands and functions available to
operators in the charybdis ircd, as used on
`AthemeNet <http://www.atheme.net>`__.

This document, and various ideas for features of charybdis, have been
taken from dancer-ircd/hyperion, the ircd used on freenode, mainly
written by Andrew Suffield and Jilles Tjoelker.

While this document may be of some interest to the users of charybdis
servers, it is intended as a reference for network staff.

Charybdis is based on ircd-ratbox 2.1.4, although much has changed.
`ircd-ratbox <http://www.ircd-ratbox.org>`__ is commonly used on efnet,
and some other networks.
