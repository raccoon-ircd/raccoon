Important configuration notes:

The configuration is interpreted from top to bottom, unlike in IRCds that use
the colon-delimited configuration block format.

Some blocks must be listed before other types of blocks.

  class{}; must go before auth{}; and connect{}; blocks. More specific
auth{);s will be occluded if they occur after more general ones.
  privset{}; must go before oper{};.

# Extensions
/* Raccoon-IRCd has a number of extensions that are not enabled by default

 * Emulates channel mode +-R (quiet unreg) (+-q $~a) -- chm_quietunreg_compat.so
 * Emulates channel mode +-S (ssl only) (+-b $~z)    -- chm_sslonly_compat.so

 * Not recommended for normal networks:

 * Useful utilities:
 * Unrealish host-mangling (umode +x, configurable)  !! ip_cloaking_5.so
 * Host-mangling that doesn't require OpenSSL (+x)   !! ip_cloaking_5nolssl.so
 * The above two conflict.
